                    A student reported seeing "a large hairy beast" running past the dorms 
                    on Thursday evening.  While some say this is just another case of an 
                    unkempt co-ed, some have conjectured this was none other than the legendary 
                    bigfoot.  You can see from the map below our small state has a history of 
                    such sightings.  Local news station WOWKTV dives deeper into the phenomenon

                    <p>Winter storms have gripped our area recently, depositing large amounts of 
                    snow.  Many see these storms as beautiful natural events, others see them as 
                    nuisances.  Whether nuisance or natural wonder the result for many of us is 
                    time spent shoveling snow.</p>
                  <p>I conducted my own extended personal study on snow shoveling this week.  
                  After many sessions, I concluded the following benefits:
                  <ul>
                         <li>Allows me to leave my house.</li>
                       <li>Burns many calories.</li>
                    <li>Makes me appreciate spring and summer.</li>
                  </ul></p>
